# Portfolio
CSS-Bootstrap Homework

Created a simple website featuring an "About Me", "Portfolio" and "Contact" page.

Focus of the website was to employ bootstrap skills and to make the website responsive for enhanced viewing through multiple devices.

Currently photos on "Portfolio" page do not link to those various projects.  Will update that in the future.
